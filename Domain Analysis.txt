Domain Analysis

In order to save time, create Schools on separate files and load  them to main to run.
Have functions like make teachers, make students etc... . Use for loops and generate some random data to save time when making 
these.  

The Management class will hold important values that will set limits and prevent the creation of things that go over the
set limits. In addition it will keep track of important things.

Each class will have its own add dropp functions, and will keep a list. 
The super class will keep a reference(pointer?) to that list held in the sub class. 
Accessing these lists should be done through the management class
